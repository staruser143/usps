The USPS API, including the Address Validation (or Address Information) API, is generally offered free of charge by the United States Postal Service for developers and businesses to use. However, there are certain limitations and considerations to be aware of when using the USPS API for large-scale address standardization:

### **1. API Usage Limitations:**
- **Daily Request Limits:** USPS imposes a daily limit on the number of API requests. For example, the default limit might be 5,000 requests per day. If you're processing a large customer database, you might quickly hit these limits.
- **Terms of Use:** The free usage of the API is typically intended for low to moderate volume applications, such as validating addresses during customer sign-up or checkout processes. Large-scale batch processing, such as standardizing an entire customer database with millions of entries, may not be fully supported under the free terms.
- **Fair Usage:** If the API is used excessively or for purposes beyond normal business operations (e.g., large-scale data processing), USPS may restrict access or require that you contact them for a different usage plan.

### **2. Commercial Use and Bulk Processing:**
- **EULA and Restrictions:** The USPS API’s End User License Agreement (EULA) generally prohibits the resale or redistribution of the address data obtained through the API. If you need to process a large volume of addresses regularly, you might be required to negotiate a special agreement with USPS or a third-party provider that integrates USPS data.
- **Third-Party Providers:** For businesses needing to standardize addresses on a large scale, third-party services that leverage USPS data may be more appropriate. These providers offer commercial APIs or software that can handle large batches of addresses, often with additional features like enhanced data quality, international address standardization, and advanced analytics.

### **3. Alternatives for Large-Scale Address Standardization:**
While the USPS API is free, here are a few alternatives that might be more suited for large-scale operations:

- **SmartyStreets:**
  - **Pricing:** Offers different pricing tiers based on the number of address validations required. For example, a few thousand requests might be free, but for millions of addresses, they offer enterprise-level plans that can be negotiated based on volume.
  - **Features:** Provides both U.S. and international address standardization, additional metadata, and advanced matching algorithms.

- **Melissa:**
  - **Pricing:** Melissa’s services are tailored to enterprise needs, and pricing is usually based on the number of records processed. They offer plans for bulk processing with additional services like geocoding, demographic data, and real-time processing.
  - **Features:** Address standardization, deduplication, and data enhancement across multiple countries.

- **Loqate:**
  - **Pricing:** Loqate offers tiered pricing based on the number of address lookups or validations. For large volumes, custom pricing is available.
  - **Features:** Comprehensive global address validation, batch processing capabilities, and additional data enrichment.

### **4. Estimating Costs for Large-Scale Address Standardization:**
If you're looking to standardize addresses for a large customer database, the costs will depend on the specific service you choose, the number of addresses you need to process, and the frequency of processing. 

For example, if you were to use a third-party provider like SmartyStreets or Melissa for processing 1 million addresses:

- **Cost Range**: Could range from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars annually, depending on the complexity of the service, additional features like geocoding or data enrichment, and the need for ongoing address standardization versus one-time processing.

### **Conclusion:**
While the USPS Address Validation API is a cost-effective option for small to medium-sized tasks, large-scale address standardization might require either negotiating directly with USPS or using a third-party service that offers robust, scalable solutions tailored for high-volume needs. The cost will vary based on the service provider and the scale of your operations, so it’s important to evaluate based on your specific business requirements.
