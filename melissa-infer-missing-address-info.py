Yes, the Melissa Address Verification API is designed to work with partial or incomplete address information. It can often infer missing components based on the information provided. Here's how it generally handles incomplete addresses:

1. Partial Information: If you provide some components of an address, Melissa will attempt to fill in the missing pieces. For example, if you only have a street address and ZIP code, it might be able to determine the city and state.

2. Fuzzy Matching: The API uses advanced matching algorithms to handle misspellings, alternate spellings, and incomplete information.

3. Multiple Results: In cases where the provided information could match multiple addresses, the API may return multiple possible matches.

Here's an example of how you might use the API with incomplete information:

```python
import requests
import json

def verify_incomplete_address(partial_address):
    api_key = 'YOUR_MELISSA_API_KEY'
    url = 'https://globalonepak.melissadata.net/WEB/GlobalAddress/doGlobalAddress'
    
    params = {
        'id': api_key,
        'format': 'json',
        'a': partial_address,
        'ctry': 'US'
    }
    
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        
        if data['Records']:
            results = data['Records'][0]
            if results['Results']:
                return {
                    'address_line1': results.get('AddressLine1', ''),
                    'address_line2': results.get('AddressLine2', ''),
                    'city': results.get('Locality', ''),
                    'state': results.get('AdministrativeArea', ''),
                    'zip_code': results.get('PostalCode', ''),
                    'country': results.get('CountryName', ''),
                    'result_codes': results['Results']
                }
            else:
                return f"Address could not be verified. Result codes: {results['Results']}"
        else:
            return "No results found"
    else:
        return f"API request failed with status code: {response.status_code}"

# Example usage with incomplete addresses
partial_addresses = [
    "123 Main St, 90210",
    "1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Washington",
    "Empire State Building, NY"
]

for address in partial_addresses:
    result = verify_incomplete_address(address)
    print(f"Input: {address}")
    print(f"Result: {json.dumps(result, indent=2)}\n")
```

In this example:

1. We're passing incomplete address strings to the API.
2. The API attempts to fill in missing information and standardize the address.
3. We're including the 'result_codes' in the output, which can provide insight into how the API processed the address.

Keep in mind:

- The API's ability to complete partial addresses depends on the uniqueness and accuracy of the provided information.
- In some cases, it might not be able to determine a single definitive address and may return multiple possibilities or an error.
- The 'Results' field in the API response contains codes that indicate how the address was processed. These can be useful for understanding the confidence level of the match.

When working with incomplete addresses, it's a good practice to:

1. Check the result codes to understand how confident the API is in its match.
2. Implement error handling for cases where the API can't determine a unique address.
3. Consider implementing a process for manual review of low-confidence matches if accuracy is critical for your application.

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?
