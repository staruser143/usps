Yes, you can generate UUIDs in PySpark after standardizing the different address parts and then use these UUIDs to compare if two addresses are the same across rows. This approach involves the following steps:

1. Standardize the Address: First, you'll standardize the address by combining the different address parts (e.g., street address, city, state, ZIP code) into a single standardized string.


2. Generate a UUID: You can then generate a UUID based on the standardized address string. A common way to do this is by using a hashing function like MD5 or SHA-1, which ensures that the same standardized address will always produce the same UUID.


3. Compare Addresses: Finally, you can compare the generated UUIDs to determine if two addresses are the same.



Implementation in PySpark

Here’s how you can do this step by step:

1. Standardize the Address

First, combine and standardize the address components using PySpark’s built-in string functions:

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import concat_ws, lower, trim, col

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Address UUID").getOrCreate()

# Example DataFrame with address parts
data = [
    ("123 Main St", "Springfield", "IL", "62701"),
    ("123 Main Street", "springfield", "IL", "62701"),
    ("456 Elm St", "Springfield", "IL", "62702")
]
columns = ["street_address", "city", "state", "zip_code"]

df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

# Standardize the address by concatenating and cleaning the parts
df = df.withColumn(
    "standardized_address",
    lower(trim(concat_ws(" ", col("street_address"), col("city"), col("state"), col("zip_code"))))
)

2. Generate UUIDs Using a Hash Function

Next, use a hash function like MD5 or SHA-1 to generate a UUID from the standardized address string:

from pyspark.sql.functions import md5

# Generate a UUID using MD5 based on the standardized address
df = df.withColumn("address_uuid", md5(col("standardized_address")))

df.show(truncate=False)

This will produce a DataFrame with a standardized address and its corresponding UUID.

3. Compare UUIDs to Identify Duplicate Addresses

Now that you have a UUID for each standardized address, you can compare UUIDs to check if two addresses are the same:

# Example: Find duplicate addresses by grouping by the UUID
duplicate_addresses = df.groupBy("address_uuid").count().filter("count > 1")

# Show duplicate addresses
duplicate_addresses.show(truncate=False)

Example Output

Let's assume the example data provided:

+----------------+-----------+-----+--------+--------------------------------+----------------------------------
| street_address | city      | state| zip_code| standardized_address           | address_uuid                    |
+----------------+-----------+-----+--------+--------------------------------+----------------------------------
| 123 Main St    | Springfield | IL  | 62701  | 123 main st springfield il 62701| c9f0f895fb98ab9159f51fd0297e236d|
| 123 Main Street| springfield| IL  | 62701  | 123 main street springfield il 62701| c9f0f895fb98ab9159f51fd0297e236d|
| 456 Elm St     | Springfield | IL  | 62702  | 456 elm st springfield il 62702| d8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4|
+----------------+-----------+-----+--------+--------------------------------+----------------------------------

In this example, the first two addresses are standardized to the same format, resulting in the same UUID, indicating that they are effectively the same address.

Important Notes

Hash Collisions: While hash functions like MD5 are generally reliable, they are not entirely collision-proof. For most practical purposes, this approach will work well, but be aware that theoretically, two different addresses could produce the same hash.

Performance: Hashing functions like MD5 are quite fast and suitable for large datasets, but the performance may vary depending on the size and complexity of your data.

Standardization: Ensure that your standardization logic is robust enough to handle variations in the address format, such as different abbreviations, spacing, and casing, to avoid false negatives.


By following this approach, you can effectively generate UUIDs for standardized addresses and compare them across rows in PySpark, enabling you to identify duplicate or matching addresses efficiently.
