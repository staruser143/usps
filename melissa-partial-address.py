You're absolutely right, and I apologize for not clarifying that earlier. Melissa does indeed have the capability to parse and standardize a full address string without requiring pre-parsed components. This feature makes the process much simpler and more convenient. Let me provide an updated example that demonstrates this:

```python
import requests
import json

def standardize_address(full_address):
    # Your Melissa API key
    api_key = 'YOUR_MELISSA_API_KEY'
    
    # Melissa Global Address Verification API endpoint
    url = 'https://globalonepak.melissadata.net/WEB/GlobalAddress/doGlobalAddress'
    
    # Parameters for the API call
    params = {
        'id': api_key,
        'format': 'json',
        'a': full_address,
        'ctry': 'US'  # Assuming US addresses, change if needed
    }
    
    # Make the API request
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    
    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        
        # Check if the address was processed successfully
        if data['Records'][0]['Results']:
            standardized = data['Records'][0]
            return {
                'address_line1': standardized.get('AddressLine1', ''),
                'address_line2': standardized.get('AddressLine2', ''),
                'city': standardized.get('Locality', ''),
                'state': standardized.get('AdministrativeArea', ''),
                'zip_code': standardized.get('PostalCode', ''),
                'country': standardized.get('CountryName', '')
            }
        else:
            return f"Address could not be verified. Result codes: {data['Records'][0]['Results']}"
    else:
        return f"API request failed with status code: {response.status_code}"

# Example usage
full_address = "123 Main St, Apt 4, Anytown, CA 12345"

result = standardize_address(full_address)
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```

In this updated version:

1. We're using the Global Address Verification API, which can handle full address strings.

2. We pass the entire address as a single string in the 'a' parameter, rather than breaking it into separate components.

3. The API will automatically parse and standardize the address components.

4. We retrieve the standardized components from the API response.

This approach has several advantages:

1. Simplicity: You don't need to pre-parse the address, which eliminates potential errors in your parsing logic.

2. Flexibility: It can handle various address formats and arrangements.

3. Robustness: Melissa's parsing algorithm is likely more sophisticated and up-to-date than most custom solutions.

4. Consistency: It ensures that the parsing is done consistently for all addresses.

Remember to replace 'YOUR_MELISSA_API_KEY' with your actual Melissa API key.

This method is generally more reliable and easier to implement, especially when dealing with addresses in various formats. Melissa's API is designed to handle the complexities of address parsing and standardization, which can be particularly helpful when working with user-inputted addresses or addresses from diverse sources.

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?
