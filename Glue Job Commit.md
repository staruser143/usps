You should not use job.commit() in the script in the following scenarios:

1. Error Handling and Failures

Scenario: If your script encounters an error or exception during execution and you want the job to fail and not be marked as completed.

Reason: Calling job.commit() indicates a successful job run. If your script fails or encounters errors, omitting job.commit() will prevent the job from being marked as complete, allowing you to investigate and rerun the job without AWS Glue marking the data as processed (if job bookmarks are used).

What to Do: Implement error handling (try-except blocks). If an error occurs, avoid calling job.commit():

try:
    # Your ETL code
except Exception as e:
    # Handle error (e.g., log error)
    print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
    # Do not call job.commit()


2. Testing and Debugging

Scenario: When testing or debugging your ETL script, and you don't want to update the job's state.

Reason: During development or debugging, you might want to run your script multiple times with the same input data without updating the job's state or bookmarks. This allows you to repeat the test on the same data without Glue skipping already processed data in subsequent runs.

What to Do: Comment out or skip job.commit() in the script during testing to prevent Glue from updating its bookmarks or job state.

# During testing, do not call job.commit()
# job.commit()


3. Non-Incremental Data Processing

Scenario: If your job processes the entire dataset each time (full refresh) and does not rely on incremental processing.

Reason: Job bookmarks are mainly beneficial for incremental data processing. If your job reprocesses all data each time, job bookmarking and state management are unnecessary. You can skip job.commit() since job bookmarking won't be used.

What to Do: If bookmarks are irrelevant to your job logic, you can skip calling job.commit() to save unnecessary overhead.

# If not using bookmarks, no need for job.commit()
# job.commit()


4. Manual Job State Management

Scenario: You have custom logic to manage job state and data processing outside AWS Glue's bookmarking system.

Reason: Some workflows may have specific state management requirements that don't fit AWS Glue's built-in job bookmarking. In such cases, you might handle state using custom markers in a database, file system, or other mechanisms.

What to Do: Implement your state tracking logic and avoid using job.commit() to prevent Glue from interfering with your custom state management.

# Implement custom state management
# Do not call job.commit()


5. Read-Only Jobs

Scenario: Jobs that only read data and do not perform any modifications or transformations that need tracking.

Reason: If your job only reads data and doesn't need to mark anything as processed (e.g., generating reports), job bookmarking is unnecessary, and you can skip calling job.commit().

What to Do: If the job's purpose is solely to read data without processing state, avoid job.commit().

# Read-only job, no need to commit
# job.commit()


Summary

Use job.commit() when you need Glue to acknowledge a successful job run, typically for incremental processing using job bookmarks.

Avoid job.commit() when dealing with errors, during testing, in non-incremental jobs, when managing job state manually, or for read-only operations.


By controlling when you call job.commit(), you can manage how AWS Glue tracks the state and processes your data, ensuring proper job behavior tailored to your workflow.
