Yes, Melissa (formerly known as Melissa Data) does support address standardization functionality through their API. They offer a comprehensive suite of data quality and address management tools, including address verification, standardization, and geocoding.

Here's an overview of how you might use the Melissa Address Verification API with Python:

1. First, you'll need to sign up for a Melissa API key.

2. Then, you can use the `requests` library in Python to make API calls.

Here's a basic example of how to use the Melissa Address Verification API:

```python
import requests
import json

def standardize_address(address, city, state, zip_code):
    # Your Melissa API key
    api_key = 'YOUR_MELISSA_API_KEY'
    
    # Melissa Address Verification API endpoint
    url = 'https://address.melissadata.net/v3/WEB/AddressVerify/doAddressVerify'
    
    # Parameters for the API call
    params = {
        'id': api_key,
        'format': 'json',
        'a1': address,
        'city': city,
        'state': state,
        'postal': zip_code,
        'ctry': 'USA'
    }
    
    # Make the API request
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    
    # Check if the request was successful
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        
        # Check if the address was verified
        if data['Records'][0]['Results'] == 'AS01':
            standardized = data['Records'][0]
            return {
                'address_line1': standardized['AddressLine1'],
                'address_line2': standardized['AddressLine2'],
                'city': standardized['City'],
                'state': standardized['State'],
                'zip_code': standardized['PostalCode'],
                'zip_plus_four': standardized['Plus4'],
                'country': standardized['Country']
            }
        else:
            return f"Address could not be verified. Result code: {data['Records'][0]['Results']}"
    else:
        return f"API request failed with status code: {response.status_code}"

# Example usage
address = "123 Main St"
city = "Anytown"
state = "CA"
zip_code = "12345"

result = standardize_address(address, city, state, zip_code)
print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```

This script does the following:

1. Defines a function `standardize_address` that takes address components as input.
2. Constructs the API request with the necessary parameters.
3. Sends a GET request to the Melissa Address Verification API.
4. Checks if the request was successful and if the address was verified.
5. If verified, it returns a dictionary with the standardized address components.

Key benefits of using Melissa's API:

1. High accuracy: Melissa maintains up-to-date postal databases.
2. Comprehensive: It can handle various address formats and provide additional data like geocodes.
3. International support: While this example is for US addresses, Melissa supports international addresses as well.
4. Additional features: Their API can provide other useful information like address type (residential/commercial), delivery point validation, and more.

Remember to replace 'YOUR_MELISSA_API_KEY' with your actual API key from Melissa. Also, be aware that using this API will incur costs based on your plan with Melissa.

When working with APIs like this, it's always a good practice to implement error handling and potentially caching to optimize performance and handle API limits.
